# TODO List

## High Priority
- [ ] Calendar view of upcoming hockey games (1 week view)
- [ ] Interactive guitar fretboard

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Icons or some way to distinguish between Ice Pack and Druckerman games
- [ ] Look into a subdir for lume pages, so we don't have to worry about explicitly excluding new files all the time.

## Low Priority
- [ ] Add favicon

## Completed
- [x] Need to invalidate stylesheet on deploy (should I invalidate everything? in the cloudfront cache?)
- [x] Better mobile styling
- [x] Make lume ignore infra folder

## Notes
- Use [ ] for incomplete tasks
- Use [x] for completed tasks
- Add dates when tasks are completed
- Add @tags for context (e.g., @work, @personal)
- Add ! for priority levels (!!! = high, !! = medium, ! = low)
