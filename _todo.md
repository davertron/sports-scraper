# TODO List

## High Priority
- [ ] @hockey: Completely redesign hockey page
    - [ ] Get rid of separate "Next game" and "full schedule" sections
    - [ ] Make each game a cool card; add images for teams for ice pack and druckerman
    - [ ] Make next game card bigger at the top of the page, and a bit fancier
    - [ ] User color to distinguish between ice pack and druckerman games
- [ ] @guitar: Add "interval" label to highlights for scales
- [ ] @guitar: Add a "scale" mode to the guitar app, where you can select a scale and see the positions of the notes on the fretboard.
- [ ] @guitar: Add a "chord" mode to the guitar app, where you can select a chord and see the positions of the notes on the fretboard.

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Icons or some way to distinguish between Ice Pack and Druckerman games
- [ ] Look into a subdir for lume pages, so we don't have to worry about explicitly excluding new files all the time.

## Low Priority
- [ ] Add favicon

## Completed
- [x] Need to invalidate stylesheet on deploy (should I invalidate everything? in the cloudfront cache?)
- [x] Better mobile styling
- [x] Make lume ignore infra folder
- [x] Basic guitar fretboard app
- [x] Benchapp import tool
- [x] @guitar: Add better dynamic styling for guitar app. Currently it's hard-coded, it should be dynamic based on viewport size etc.
- [x] @guitar: Add styling of highlights (i.e. color root note differently)
- [x] @guitar: Add a "note" mode to the guitar app, where you can select a note and see every position of that note on the fretboard.

## Notes
- Use [ ] for incomplete tasks
- Use [x] for completed tasks
- Add dates when tasks are completed
- Add @tags for context (e.g., @work, @personal)
- Add ! for priority levels (!!! = high, !! = medium, ! = low)
