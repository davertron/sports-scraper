# TODO List

## High Priority
- [ ] Calendar view of upcoming hockey games (1 week view)

- [ ] @guitar: Add styling of highlights (i.e. color root note differently)
- [ ] @guitar: Add "interval" label to highlights for scales
- [ ] @guitar: Add a "note" mode to the guitar app, where you can select a note and see every position of that note on the fretboard.
- [ ] @guitar: Add a "scale" mode to the guitar app, where you can select a scale and see the positions of the notes on the fretboard.
- [ ] @guitar: Add a "chord" mode to the guitar app, where you can select a chord and see the positions of the notes on the fretboard.

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Icons or some way to distinguish between Ice Pack and Druckerman games
- [ ] Look into a subdir for lume pages, so we don't have to worry about explicitly excluding new files all the time.

## Low Priority
- [ ] Add favicon

## Completed
- [x] Need to invalidate stylesheet on deploy (should I invalidate everything? in the cloudfront cache?)
- [x] Better mobile styling

## Notes
- Use [ ] for incomplete tasks
