# TODO List

## High Priority

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Need to invalidate stylesheet on deploy (should I invalidate everything? in the cloudfront cache?)

## Low Priority

## Completed

## Notes
- Use [ ] for incomplete tasks
- Use [x] for completed tasks
- Add dates when tasks are completed
- Add @tags for context (e.g., @work, @personal)
- Add ! for priority levels (!!! = high, !! = medium, ! = low)
