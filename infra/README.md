# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

This is a blank project for CDK development with TypeScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `npx cdk deploy`  deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `npx cdk diff`    compare deployed stack with current state
* `npx cdk synth`   emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

### First Time Setup

1. `npm run build`
2. `cdk bootstrap`
3. `cdk deploy`

### Deploy Process

1. `npm run build`
2. `cdk diff` # Optional, to see what will be deployed
3. `cdk deploy`

## Node/Deno

The overall project is built using Deno, but this part requires node/npm to work properly.
